# State

State is the core work horse of Solid. It represents the local data, the output all the asynchronous interaction as a simple to read javascript object. While fine grained observable itself it is has a minimal API footprint and in most cases be treated like a normal object when reading, supporting destructuring and native methods. However you are dealing with proxy objects that automatically tracked as dependencies of memoization and effects and upon changing will force evaluation.

While this state concept is heavily borrowed from React and it's API from ImmutableJS, there is a key difference in the role it plays here. In React you keep things simple in your state and the whole library is about reconciling DOM rendering. Here you can almost view the State object as the target, the thing that is diffed and maintained. The DOM rendering is actually quite simple to the point the compiled source exposes the vast majority of the DOM manipulations, where you can easily drop a breakpoint. So change detection being nested and focusing on interaction with other change mechanisms are key.

### `createState(object)`

Initializes with object value and returns an array where the first index is the state object and the second is the setState method.

### `setState(changes)`

### `setState(...path, changes)`

### `setState([...path, changes], [...path, changes])`

This merges the changes into the path on the state object. All changes made in a single setState command are applied syncronously (ie all changes see each other at the same time). Changes can take the form of function that passes previous state and returns new state or a value. Objects are always merged.

```js
const [state, setState] = createState({ firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Miller' });

setState({ firstName: 'Johnny', middleName: 'Lee' })
// ({ firstName: 'Johnny', middleName: 'Lee', lastName: 'Miller' })

setState(state => { preferredName: state.firstName, lastName: 'Milner' });
// ({ firstName: 'Johnny', preferredName: 'Johnny', middleName: 'Lee', lastName: 'Milner' })
```

The function form is not terribly useful top level given Solid's synchronous nature. However, setState also supports nested setting where you can indicate the path to the change. When nested the state you are updating may be other non Object values. Objects are still merged but other values (including Arrays) are replaced.

```js
const [state, setState] = createState({
  counter: 2,
  list: [
    { id: 23, title: 'Birds' }
    { id: 27, title: 'Fish' }
  ]
});

setState('counter', c => c + 1);
setState('list', l => [...l, {id: 43, title: 'Marsupials'}]);
setState('list', 2, 'read', true);
// {
//   counter: 3,
//   list: [
//     { id: 23, title: 'Birds' }
//     { id: 27, title: 'Fish' }
//     { id: 43, title: 'Marsupials', read: true }
//   ]
// }
```

Path can be string keys, array of keys, iterating objects ({from, to, by}), or filter functions. This gives incredible expressive power to describe state changes.

```js
const [state, setState] = createState({
  todos: [
    { task: 'Finish work', completed: false }
    { task: 'Go grocery shopping', completed: false }
    { task: 'Make dinner', completed: false }
  ]
});

setState('todos', [0, 2], 'completed', true);
// {
//   todos: [
//     { task: 'Finish work', completed: true }
//     { task: 'Go grocery shopping', completed: false }
//     { task: 'Make dinner', completed: true }
//   ]
// }

setState('todos', { from: 0, to: 1 }, 'completed', c => !c);
// {
//   todos: [
//     { task: 'Finish work', completed: false }
//     { task: 'Go grocery shopping', completed: true }
//     { task: 'Make dinner', completed: true }
//   ]
// }

setState('todos', todo => todo.completed, 'task', t => t + '!')
// {
//   todos: [
//     { task: 'Finish work', completed: false }
//     { task: 'Go grocery shopping!', completed: true }
//     { task: 'Make dinner!', completed: true }
//   ]
// }

setState('todos', {}, todo => { marked: true, completed: !todo.completed })
// {
//   todos: [
//     { task: 'Finish work', completed: true, marked: true }
//     { task: 'Go grocery shopping!', completed: false, marked: true }
//     { task: 'Make dinner!', completed: false, marked: true }
//   ]
// }
```

Additionally you can do multiple sets in a single call by passing an array of paths and changes.

```js
const [state, setState] = createState({
  counter: 2,
  list: [
    { id: 23, title: 'Birds' }
    { id: 27, title: 'Fish' }
  ]
});

setState(
  ['counter', c => c * 3],
  ['list', 1, 'title', t => t + '!']
);
// {
//   counter: 6,
//   list: [
//     { id: 23, title: 'Birds' }
//     { id: 27, title: 'Fish!' }
//   ]
// }
```

## Modifiers

This library also provides of state setter modifiers which can optionally be included to provide different behavior when setting state.

### `force(changes)`

### `force(...path, changes)`

### `force([...path, changes], [...path, changes])`

By default state only updates on value change. To get typical signal like behavior on a change you can force update using the force modifier.

```js
setState(force({ name: "John" }));
```

### `reconcile(...path, value)`

This can be used to do deep diffs by applying the changes from a new State value. This is useful when pulling in immutable data trees from stores to ensure the least amount of mutations to your state. It can also be used to replace the all keys on the base state object if no path is provided as it does both positive and negative diff.

```js
setState(reconcile("users", store.get("users")));
```

If you pass as array you can configure the diff algorithm with an options object:

```js
setState(reconcile(
  ['users', store.get('users')],
  {
    key: '_id' // does a keyed comparison - default: 'id'
    merge: false //  overwrites rather than detects array position changes when not keyed - default: false
  }
))
```
