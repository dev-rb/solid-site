# Core API

### `createState(initValue): [state, setState]`

Creates a new State object and setState pair that can be used to maintain your componenents state. State only triggers update on values changing. Tracking is done by intercepting property access and automatically tracks deep nesting via proxy.

### `createSignal(initialValue, comparatorFn): [getValueFn, setValueFn]`

This is the smallest and most primitive reactive atom used to track a single value. By default signals always notify on setting a value. However a comparator can be passed in to indicate whether the values should be considered equal and listeners not notified.

### `createEffect(prev => <code>, initialValue): void`

Creates a new effect that automatically tracks dependencies. 2nd argument is the initial value.

### `createMemo(prev => <code>, initialValue, comparatorFn): getValueFn`

Creates a readonly signal that recalculates it's value whenever the executed codes dependencies update. Memos only notify dependents when returned value changes. You can also set a custom comparator.

### `onCleanup(() => <code>)`

Registers a cleanup methodthat executes on disposal or recalculation of the current context.

### `createContext(defaultContext): Context`

Creates a new context object that can be used with useContext and the Provider control flow. Default Context is used when no Provider is found above in the hierarchy.

### `useContext(Context): any`

Hook to grab context to allow for deep passing of props with hierarchal resolution of dependencies without having to pass them through each Component function.

# Additional API

The following are not required to build simple applications but allow a lot more power and control.

### `createRoot(disposer => <code>)`

Creates a new non-tracked context that doesn't auto-dispose. All Solid code should be wrapped in one of these top level as they ensure that all memory/computations are freed up.

### `sample(() => <code>): any`

Ignores tracking any of the dependencies in the executing code block and returns the value.

### `freeze(() => <code>): any`

Ensures that all updates within the block happen at the same time to prevent unnecessary recalculation. Solid State's setState method and computations(useEffect, useMemo) automatically wrap their code in freeze blocks.

### `onError((err: any) => <code>)`

Registers a error handler method that executes when child context errors. Only nearest context error handlers execute. Rethrow to trigger up the line.

### `createDeferred(prev => <code>, options: { timeoutMs: number }): getValueFn`

Creates memo that only notifies downstream changes when the browser is idle. `timeoutMS` is the maximum time to wait before forcing the update.

### `createDependentEffect(() => <code>, dependencies, defer): void`

Creates a new effect that explicitly tracks dependencies. The 2nd optional argument is an explicit array of dependencies. The 3rd optional argument is whether to defer initial execution of the effect until a value has changed (this only works with explicit dependencies).

### `createResource(initialValue): [getValueFn, loadFn]`

Creates a new resource signal that can hold a async resource. Resources when read while loading trigger Suspense. The `loadFn` takes a promise whose resolved value is set in the resource.

### `createResourceState(initialValue): [state, loadState, setState]`

Creates a new Resource State object. Similar to normal state except each immediate property is a resource.

### `afterEffects(() => <code>)`

Registers a method that will run after the current execution process is complete. These are useful when waiting on refs to resolves or child DOM nodes to render.

### `lazy(() => <Promise>): Component`

Used to lazy load components to allow for things like code splitting and Suspense.

### `setDefaults(props, defaultProps): void`

Sets default props for function components in case caller doesn't provide them.

### `cloneProps(props): newProps`

Clones the props object including reactive properties.
