Sometimes you have multiple `Suspense` Components you wish to coordinate. Sure you could put everything under a single `Suspense` but that limits us to a single loading behavior. A single fallback state and everything always needs to wait until the last thing is loaded. Instead we introduce the `SuspenseList` Component to coordinate.

Consider having multiple `Suspense` components like our example. If we wrap this with a `SuspenseList` configured with `revealOrder` of `forwards` they will render in the order they appear in the tree regardless of the order they load. This reduces page jumping around. You can set `revealOrder` to `backwards` and `together` as well, which reverse this order, or wait for all Suspense Components to load respectively. In addition there is a `tail` option that can be set to `hidden` or `collapsed`. This overrides the default behavior of showing all fallbacks, with either showing none or showing the next one in the direction set by `revealOrder`.
